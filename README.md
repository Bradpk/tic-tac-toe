### Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is an emulation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, with the goal of getting three of their marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game provides a user-friendly interface indicating whose turn it is and displaying the winner when the game is won.
